# Docker images for Parrot OS

Docker is a powerful technology that allows users to run containers universally on any host platform.

Docker uses template images, and allows the user to start several instances of the same template, destroy them, or build new custom templates on top of them.

Parrot uses docker to allow its users to use its vast arsenal of tools on any platform supported by docker.

# Available Templates

Whether you want to have a container full of tools, or several smaller containers with a tiny selection of tools, or even a clean Parrot environment to build yor custom stack on, this is the right place where to learn how to take advantage of the Parrot Docker workspace.

## parrotsec/core

Core system with just the Parrot basics.
You can use it as a start point to create your custom containers.

available flavors:

**parrotsec/core:latest** based on parrot rolling (debian testing) amd64

**parrotsec/core:rolling-amd64** based on parrot rolling (debian testing) amd64

**parrotsec/core:rolling-i386** based on parrot rolling (debian testing) i386

**parrotsec/core:lts-amd64** based on parrot lts (devuan stable) amd64

**parrotsec/core:lts-i386** based on parrot lts (devuan stable) i386

**parrotsec/core:lts-arm64** based on parrot lts (devuan stable) arm64

**parrotsec/core:lts-armhf** based on parrot lts (devuan stable) armhf

launch the container:

`docker run --rm -ti --network host -v $PWD/work:/work parrotsec/core:lts-amd64`


## parrotsec/security

This container includes a huge collection of tools that can be used via command line from inside a docker container.

Some tools with graphical interface were excluded for obvious reasons.

This container ships with the following metapackages:

* parrot-pico
* parrot-mini
* parrot-tools-cloud

available flavors:

**parrotsec/security:latest** built over parrotsec/core:rolling-amd64

**parrotsec/security:rolling** built over parrotsec/core:rolling-amd64

**parrotsec/security:lts** built over parrotsec/core:lts-amd64

Launch the container:

`docker run --rm -ti --network host -v $PWD/work:/work parrotsec/security`


## parrotsec/tools-*

This is a curated selection of smaller docker containers that contain only specific tools, alone or in cherry-picked collections.

Containers with shared tools are stacked on top of each other (when possible) to minimize storage waste and maximize layers reuse.

available templates:

### parrotsec/tools-nmap

## parrotsec/build

This container is used internally by the Parrot Build Platform to test and build the distro packages.

Even if it is not meant to be used directly by users, it contains all the tools to work on debian packaging and properly test package builds in clean and disposable environments.

This container ships with the following packages:

* git-buildpackage
* ubuntu-dev-tools
* devscripts
* debhelper
* dh-apparmor
* dh-autoreconf
* dh-buildinfo
* dh-cargo
* dh-consoledata
* dh-di
* dh-exec
* dh-golang
* dh-linktree
* dh-lisp
* dh-lua
* dh-make
* dh-make-golang
* dh-make-perl
* dh-metainit
* dh-perl6
* dh-php
* dh-python

* kernel-wedge

Available flavors:

**parrotsec/build:latest** based on parrotsec/core:rolling-amd64

**parrotsec/build:rolling-amd64** based on parrotsec/core:rolling-amd64

**parrotsec/build:rolling-i386** based on parrotsec/core:rolling-i386

cd metasploit-framework
<make your modfications to the package here>
cd ..
docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/build/ parrotsec/build:rolling-amd64 - bash

cd /build/metasploit-framework
apt build-dep .
debuild -us -uc
exit
```


# General Usage Instructions and Examples

## Launch a container:
`docker run --name pcore-1 -ti parrotsec/core`
	NOTE: the pcore-1 name is arbitrary and can be customized

## Stop the container:
`docker stop pcore-1`

## Resume a previously-stopped container:
`docker start pcore-1`

## Remove a container after use:
`docker rm pcore-1`

## List all the instantiated containers:
`docker ps -a`

## Start multiple containers:
on terminal 1 -> `docker run --name pentest1 -ti parrotsec/security`
on terminal 2 -> `docker run --name pentest2 -ti parrotsec/security`
on terminal 3 -> `docker run --name msf-listener -ti parrotsec/tools-metasploit`

## Remove all the containers:
`docker rm $(docker ps -qa)`

## Start a container and automatically remove it on exit:
`docker run --rm -ti parrotsec/core`

## Use Volumes to share files with the host:
It is a good practice to not keep persistent docker containers, but to remove them on every use and make sure to save important files on a docker volume.

The following command creates a **work** folder inside the current directory and mounts it in /work inside the container.

`docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD/work:/work parrotsec/core`

## Use Volumes to share files across multiple containers:
on terminal 1 -> `docker run --name pentest -ti -v $PWD/work:/work parrotsec/security`
on terminal 2 -> `docker run --rm --network host -v $PWD/work:/work -ti parrotsec/security`
on terminal 3 -> `docker run --rm -v $PWD/work:/work -ti parrotsec/tools-metasploit`

## Open a port from the container to the host
Every docker container has its own network space connected to a virtual LAN.

All the traffic from within the docker container will be NATted by the host computer.

If you need to expose a port to other machines outside your local computer, use the following exaple:

`docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -ti parrotsec/core`

Note that the first port is the port that will be opened on your host, and the second one is the container port to bind to.

Here a reference usage of the -p flag:

**-p <host port>:<container port>** `-p 8080:80`
**-p <host port>:<container port>/<proto>** `-p 8080:80/tcp`
**-p <address>:<host port>:<container port>** `-p 192.168.1.30:8080:80` (in case of multiple adresses on host network)

## Use network host instead of docker NAT
Every docker container has its own network space connected to a virtual LAN.

All the traffic from within the docker container will be NATted by the host computer.

If you need to make the docker container share the same networking space of the host machine, then use the **--network host** flag as shown below

`docker run --rm --network host -ti parrotsec/core`

	NOTE 1: every port opened in the container will be opened on the host as well.

	NOTE 2: you can perform packet sniffing on the host network.

	NOTE 3: iptables rules applied inside the container will take effect on the host as well.
